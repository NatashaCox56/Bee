        One of the insect world’s most feared insects, but one of the majestic and sophisticated creatures on the planet. Although the fear of bees is natural, they do more good than harm. Nature as it is now wouldn’t function the same without our pollinators' help in keeping our plantlife alive and thriving. I LOVE BEES AND YOU SHOULD TOO!!!!!!

        <h2>Basic Info</h2>
        <p>
            The anatomy of the bee contains two main parts: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The top section is the head, which contains the compound eyes, and antennas, which acts almost like a second set of eyes. The thorax is the middle section, connected to six legs and two sets of wings. The abdomen is the last section of the body and the biggest part of the bee. On females, the end of the abdomen is where the stinger exists. Males do not have stingers. The stinger doubles as reproductive organs in the case a bee becomes queen. The queen lays eggs and is the only female reproducer in any given colony. Another thing to consider in identifying bees is their hairy bodies. Almost the entire body of the bee is covered in hair.

            Mixing up wasps, flies, and bees in common, but there are many indicators on insects that help figure out whether you are dealing with a bee. Number of wings, stinger type, eye type, location, and overall behavior are big clues. Here are some tips and tricks to differentiate between wasps, flies, and bees…
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wasps and bees have 4 wings, if it has 2, it is probably a fly</li>
            <li>Large bulging eyes indicate a fly</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Although some flies have compound eyes too, the eyes on flies tend to protrude greater than those of bees and wasps</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Long stingers are a pretty good sign you are dealing with a wasp. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bees tend to have short stingers and most fly stingers are extremely small.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If it's in a flower, it's probably a bee</li>
            <ul>
                <li>wasps tend to hang underneath the leaves and flowers to hunt for aphids, while bees are after the nectar in the flower.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bees are not interested in your food</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If it’s after your food, it’s probably a wasp or fly. Bees only have interest in nectar, and will not hunt for your food.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bees are hairy, while wasps are hairless and shiny with long legs</li>
        </ul>
